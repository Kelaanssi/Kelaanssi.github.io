        <h2 class="mid">About me</h2>
        <p class="mid">My name is Antti. I am a 16 year old freshman programming student in OSAO, studying many different programming languages. These languages include C#, HTML, CSS and JS.</p>

        <h2 class="mid">My hobbies</h2>
        <p class="mid">
            I have a six-year history of training as a firefighter against my will, but I chose a more suitable hobby for myself afterwards. Since then, I have been into tabletop roleplay games, such as Dungeons & Dragons.

        <p class="mid">
            During my second half of junior high, I decided to switch to the flexible basic education class. The lessons there focus more on the students' career future,
            working six different jobs in total during the two years of studying. Due to the coronavirus, however, I had only five. These include:
